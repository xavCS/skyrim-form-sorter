sifting through multiple large npc overhauls in SSEedit to delete them and use their formIDs to delete their corresponding facegen files in the file explorer
gets arduous.
 not only is it mistake prone if you accidentally delete an npc in SSEedit before using the formID to delete it in the facegen files (because you then have to
go google it), it also takes ages.
 this script will let you enter the names of all the npcs you dont want in an overhaul and it will delete their files from ANY given path, and will keep going until 
you have no more paths to delete them from.
